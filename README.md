Project Title: Simple Clinic System

Description:

This project is a web-based clinic system designed to streamline administrative tasks and enhance patient care. Currently in development, it aims to offer functionalities like:

Patient Management: Create, view, and update patient profiles, including demographics, medical history, and appointments.
Appointment Scheduling: Schedule, manage, and track appointments, with customizable features and reminders.
Medical Records: Securely store and access patient medical records, including prescriptions, lab results, and diagnosis notes.
Technologies:

Front-end:
HTML
CSS
Bootstrap
JavaScript
Back-end:
Python (Django)
Database: SQLite (for development)
Development Environment: VS Code
Setup:

Dependencies:
Make sure you have the necessary dependencies installed. This typically involves Python (version 3.6 or later), Django, and a database management system like SQLite.
Create a virtual environment:
It's highly recommended to use a virtual environment to isolate project dependencies. You can follow instructions specific to your environment (e.g., python -m venv venv).
Activate the virtual environment:
Windows: venv\Scripts\activate.bat
Linux/macOS: source venv/bin/activate
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/simple-clinic-system.git
Install project dependencies:
Navigate to the project directory and run pip install -r requirements.txt.
Create and apply database migrations:
Run python manage.py makemigrations to create database migrations based on your models.
Next, apply these migrations with python manage.py migrate.
Run the development server:
Start the Django development server using python manage.py runserver. By default, this will launch the server at http://127.0.0.1:8000/.
Usage:

The initial development setup focuses on establishing the fundamental system architecture and components. Specific usage instructions will be provided as the project evolves.
